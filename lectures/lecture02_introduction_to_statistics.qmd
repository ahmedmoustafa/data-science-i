## Introduction to Statistics

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Statistics is the science of collecting, analyzing, interpreting, presenting, and organizing data.

- **Descriptive Statistics**: Summarize and interpret data to provide meaningful insights.

- **Inferential Statistics**: Make predictions about a population based on sample data.

## Why Do We Need Statistics?

- **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Provides a basis for informed decisions.
- **Understanding Trends**: Helps identify patterns and trends.
- **Predict Future Events**: Allows for forecasting.
- **Scientific Research**: Essential in hypothesis testing and experimentation.


## Importance of Sampling

- **Efficiency**: It's often impractical to collect data from an entire population.
  
  - **Example**: Surveying all 7,000 AUC students vs. a sample of 100 students.

- **Cost-Effectiveness**: Sampling can be less expensive.

  - **Example**: Reduced cost in time and resources for surveying a smaller sample.

- **Accuracy**: Proper sampling techniques can yield highly accurate estimates.
  
  - **Example**: A well-designed survey of 100 students can accurately reflect the opinions of all 7,000 students.


## Population vs. Sample

::: columns
::: {.column width="75%"}
- **Population**: The entire group that is the subject of the study.

  - **Example**: All 7,000 students at AUC
  - **Notation**: $N$ for size, $\mu$ for mean, $\sigma$ for standard deviation

- **Sample**: A subset of the population used for making inferences about the population.

  - **Example**: A survey of 100 AUC students
  - **Notation**: $n$ for size, $\bar{x}$ for mean, $s$ for standard deviation

## Methods of Collecting Data

- **Surveys**: Questionnaires or interviews.
- **Observations**: Systematic observation and recording.
- **Experiments**: Controlled settings to observe effects.
- **Archival Data**: Existing records and databases.


## Types of Variables

- **Quantitative Variables**: Numeric data that can be measured.

  -  **Continuous**: Can take any value within a range (e.g., GPA).
  -  **Discrete**: Specific, countable values (e.g., Number of Courses).

-   **Qualitative Variables**: Descriptive, non-numeric data.

  -  **Nominal**: Categories without order (e.g., Majors).
  -  **Ordinal**: Categories with order but not equally spaced (e.g., Class Standing: Freshman, Sophomore, etc.).


## Measures of Central Tendency 1/3

-   **Mean**: The average of all data points.

    -   **Population Mean**: $\mu = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i}{N}$

        -   **Example**: Average GPA of all 7,000 AUC students is $\mu = 3.5$

    -   **Sample Mean**: $\bar{x} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{n}$

        -   **Example**: Average GPA of a sampled 100 AUC students is $\bar{x} = 3.48$

## Measures of Central Tendency 2/3

-   **Median**: Middle value when data is sorted

    -   Steps to find Median:

        -   Sort the data in ascending order

            -   If $n$ is odd, the median is the value at $\frac{n+1} 2$th position
            -   If $n$ is even, the median is the average of values at $\frac{n} 2$ and $\frac{n} 2 + 1$ positions

-   **Mode**: The most frequently occurring value.

## Measures of Central Tendency 3/3

### When to use each measure

-   Use the mean for normally distributed data
-   Use the median when the data is skewed or has outliers
-   Use the mode when dealing with categorical data

## Measures of Dispersion 1/2

-   **Range**: Difference between the **highest** and **lowest** values.

    -   **Example**: highest GPA: $4.0$, lowest GPA: $2.9$

        -   Range: $4.0âˆ’2.9=1.1$

-   **Variance**: Average of the squared differences from the Mean.

    -   **Population Variance**: $\sigma^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \mu)^2}{N}$
    -   **Sample Variance**: $s^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}$

-  **Standard Deviation**: Square root of the variance.

   - **Population Standard Deviation**: $\sigma = \sqrt{\sigma^2}$
   - **Sample Standard Deviation**: $s = \sqrt{s^2}$


## Measures of Dispersion 2/2

### When to use each measure

-  The range is great for a quick overview, but it is sensitive to outliers.
-  Variance and standard deviation are more robust and provide a clearer picture of the spread in your data.
